### **Custom Global Variables (Community-Maintained Fork) v2.0.1**
This is a community-maintained fork of the original Custom Global Variables plugin, which has not been updated in over two years.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
âœ… Whatâ€™s new in this fork
This version includes minimal but necessary improvements to ensure the plugin remains functional and maintainable:

- Enhanced admin interface with proportional layout and improved field readability
- Support for inline comments and semantic annotations in variable definitions
- Refactored internal logic for compatibility with future WordPress versions
- Editorial and structural cleanup of the pluginâ€™s documentation

All changes are fully compliant with the original GPLv2 or later license.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
## **ðŸ“¦ Original Description**
Custom Global Variables lets you define and manage your own variables such as:
- phone numbers,
- social media links,
- or HTML snippets

and access them globally in WordPress and PHP. It avoids database calls for faster performance and cleaner code.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
## **ðŸ”— Original Plugin**
You can find the original plugin on WordPress.org: https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-global-variables/ but it's version 1.2.1
